Assignment 3
=============
You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. But when you test it,
somehow the application is not reachable at the port. Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue

As its clearly mentioned that type of service is NodePort
1)one possibility of troubleshooting is we will first check it running within the cluster only for that we will change
the type of service to Cluster ip and then check it whether its working fine within cluster or not
2)Second possibility is to check whether the nodeport is correclt assigned a valid port number i.e above 30000 and below 32767
3)Another possibility might be of labelling it correctly to app because service will map to newly created pod of app-name specified by us
